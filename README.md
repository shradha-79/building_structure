# building_structure
I have completed my task.
I made it using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY  and a framework (bootstrap)
Here we can see different images(view point and isometric point) for any floor(1-5) by clicking on particular floor.

Also i was asked to add a property on the floors of a bulding to react when it is hovered and open a popup window reagrding particular floor's info but i could not do that because for that image has to be divided into diffent parts(floors) so that can add hover property on every floor image, so instead my made floor buttons to see particular floor's info.

I hope you would like my work,
Thank you.
